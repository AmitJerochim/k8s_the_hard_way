# k8s the hard way

In this project I automate k8s the hard way to learn more about kubernetes and probably linux. 
The goal of this project is being able to deploy a kubernetes cluster the hard way by running the following command:

```bash
./start_cluster
```
## security considerations
I use virtualbox on my laptop as infrastructure and vagrant to manage the lifecycle of the virtual machines. 
I do not plan using this Cluster to run anything that will ever leave my laptop. 
Also I have a full time Job and a family. This is why I decided to focus on convenience over security. 

I do not recommend using this project for anything but learning kubernetes.
